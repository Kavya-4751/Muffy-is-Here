As the player, you use the WASD keys to control Muffy, and complete the different tasks on the screen as you progress through the rooms.  

## How to play

### Navigating

* Use keyboard keys WASD for up, back, down, and forward
* Read the text located on the upper middle of the screen for directives
* (Make sure to hit the very end of the room!)
